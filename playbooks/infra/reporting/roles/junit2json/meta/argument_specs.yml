    description: |
      The resulting JSON file(s) are of the same structure for all the teams' and CI systems
      and later used to be sent to the data collection system. This is the main entrypoint
      for the role `junit2json`. Converts XMLs into JSON, if variable `junit2_do_merge` is `true`,
      multiple XMLs are merged into one XML file.
      Outputs:
        - merged filename location is stored in the variable `junit2_output_merged_report`.
        - variable `junit2_json_reports_list` contains list of all converted JSON file names
      It is user's responsibility to consumer the right variable(s) in the next role(s).

          Should we merge data of converted reports into 1 file or not. When `false`, each report `XML` file
          is converted to a corresponding json file appended `.json` extension.
          Otherwise, resulting merged report is named as the directory, with `.report.json` extension.
          In both cases, the result is stored under `junit2_output_dir`.

          This is the output variable updated by the role for the converted JSON reports file names.
          If it is defined outside of the role, the role updates it.

          If true, the call to filter should pass object=true, otherwise object=false is passed.
